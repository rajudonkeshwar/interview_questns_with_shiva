What is terraform, why should we use it? 
Ans: Terraform is a infrastructure as code tool, by using it we can create our own infrastructure through code in any cloud provider like aws, gcp
     it has multiple advantages over manually created infra
      consistent_infra: Often we face the problem of creating different infrastructure in different en, it vironment, by using terraform we create same infra
                        in defferent environments, like dev, prod, test
      Automated_infra_CRUD: By using terraform we can create entire infra in minutes, by reducing human errors, we can update and delete easily using terraform
      InventoryOfResorces: If we create infra manually it is very difficult for us to maintain inventory of resources, 
                           but if we create it using terraform it is very easy.
      CostOptimization: If you need infra you can create in minutes, you can delete it also in munutes, so in this way we can do cost optimization
      ModularInfra: We can create our own modules using terraform, we can use openSource modules also to reuse the infra code,
                    instead of spending more time to create infraform scratch we can reuse modules
      VersionControl: Since it is code we can maintain it in a git repositories for version control, we can completely maintain terraform infra history



Ansible vs terraform when to use? what is the purpose?
ANS: Ansible is popular configuration management tool, we can automate the configuration inside the server through ansible, 
     but when it comes to creating of infra ansible is very poor, it may create duplicate resource, it is very hard to write
     playbooks for updation and destruction of infra, so finally ansible is perfect choice to do configurations inside the servers, 
     terraform is perfect choice to create infrastructure, we can intigrate terraform with ansible, once terraform creates servers
     it can handover configuration management to ansible
